His insights on rethinking software testing and passion for elevating the role of the software tester have made him a sought-after speaker/author across the global software testing community. In his previous position as a senior product manager at Tricentis, he orchestrated the development and product marketing for exploratory testing, test management, test conception, test design, and test automation technologies. Before Ingo entered the multifaceted world of software testing and development, he worked as a theoretical astrophysicist in the field of high-energy particle physics and computational fluid dynamics at the University of Vienna and the Berlin Institute for Technology. He holds a Master of Science degree.",title:"Digital Transformation Requires Continuous Testing",abstract:"Digital disruption is omnipresent. Organizations are asked (more than ever before) to constantly reinvent their businesses at the speed of ideas and to keep their customers at their epicenter at the same time. Venerable companies have become comfortable breaking down silos, changing cultural norms and driving efficiency at all costs to always be one step ahead of their competition. It is not any longer the strongest that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change. Change seems to be the only thing constant, the new currency, the silver bullet to stay competitive. Big words, such as DevOps, emerged out of this fear to be second-class, and even managed to penetrate into our daily testing routines. The ability to change fast while delivering high quality has become imperative for all businesses (small, medium, large). This level of transformation requires testing to no longer be a bottleneck. It requires continuous testing to make sure that the quality of the software that is being developed is measured continuously. In this talk, Ingo Philipp outlines how to unfold continuous testing into reality.",time:"8:00 - 9:00",room:"East Ballroom"}}}}}]);
