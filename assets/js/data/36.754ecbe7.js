Organizations are asked (more than ever before) to constantly reinvent their businesses at the speed of ideas and to keep their customers at their epicenter at the same time. Venerable companies have become comfortable breaking down silos, changing cultural norms and driving efficiency at all costs to always be one step ahead of their competition. It is not any longer the strongest that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change. Change seems to be the only thing constant, the new currency, the silver bullet to stay competitive. Big words, such as DevOps, emerged out of this fear to be second-class, and even managed to penetrate into our daily testing routines. The ability to change fast while delivering high quality has become imperative for all businesses (small, medium, large). This level of transformation requires testing to no longer be a bottleneck. It requires continuous testing to make sure that the quality of the software that is being developed is measured continuously.

Sure, testers had to factor in performance under different usage conditions, but we had great testing toolsets in place to deal with that. Fast forward to the present. These days sensors enable much more diverse functionality from our connected devices or smartphones and that means mobile app testing is no longer just about testing the app. Smartphones now include many sensors that interface with the ecosystem around them. These software and hardware components can all too easily play havoc with the apps themselves. Customers expect to be able to sync data to smart watches, scan visual inputs using the camera function, perform biometric authentication, use geo-location and have their language commands processed and understood.

The more time that elapses from when code is written to when it is deployed, the more risk is actually introduced. The geography of production code is in a constant state of change, so the longer testing takes the more the landscape around and even beneath you changes, and the more risk it accrues. This rapid rate of change requires testers to broaden their vision, and shift the focus and geography of their actions.
