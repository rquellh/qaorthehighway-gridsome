This time around, Taylor wanted to ensure that only verified fans would be able to purchase these tickets. This meant that fans wanting tickets were either dedicating 80% of their time or bank accounts to Taylor Nation, LLC. Even as a very dedicated Swiftie, I did not love either of those options. I knew that there had to be a better way. In this presentation, I will show you how I utilized automation to make my way to the front of Taylor Swiftâ€™s ticket line. Come and see how automation can also be applied to simplify even non-Swiftie pursuits, including your everyday testing tasks.",time:"3:05 - 4:05",room:"Student-Alumni Room"}}}}}]);
