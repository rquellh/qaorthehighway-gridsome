How do we get group members to be more prosocial (as opposed to anti-social)? Nobel Prize winner Elinor Ostrom and SUNY Distinguished Prof. David Sloan Wilson came together to join the concepts of common pool resources and multi-level selection to start what is now called “Prosocial”. Since then many other academics and practitioners have come on board in its development, particularly psychologists working in Contextual Behavioral Science.

We will model some of the exercises and conclude with a discussion of prosocial and business practices with a particular focus on Agile.",time:"9:15 - 10:15",room:"Cartoon Room"}}}}}]);
