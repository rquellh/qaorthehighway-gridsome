They connected to the internet and incorporated one device at most. Sure, testers had to factor in performance under different usage conditions, but we had great testing toolsets in place to deal with that. Fast forward to the present. These days sensors enable much more diverse functionality from our connected devices or smartphones and that means mobile app testing is no longer just about testing the app. Smartphones now include many sensors that interface with the ecosystem around them. These software and hardware components can all too easily play havoc with the apps themselves. Customers expect to be able to sync data to smart watches, scan visual inputs using the camera function, perform biometric authentication, use geo-location and have their language commands processed and understood. And, of course, they expect it to work smoothly and the user experience to be intuitive. Organizations therefore require new strategies for test automation for this hyper-connected era. Nowadays mobile test automation is not complete unless it also incorporates how the app interacts with these sensors, peripherals and hardware. In this session, we will demonstrate the importance of making hardware and sensor testing an integral part of mobile app testing as well as share strategies for how to successfully do so. In this session, attendees will gain the following takeaways: -Overview of the complexity of peripherals testing -Demonstration of sensor testing scenarios including location, camera, TouchID and Bluetooth -Best practices, challenges and how to overcome them -Case study: Device peripheral automation for one the leading medical device & solution provider",time:"12:45 - 1:45",room:"Student Alumni Room"}}}}}]);
