Page-Object served a very useful purpose, but as Watir-classic and Watir-webdriver issues have resolved into just Watir, it's time to consider refactoring Page-Object into something faster, easier, and more extensible. I have written a new DSL that makes declaring elements easier, and can actually be extended using the same patterns for the base set of elements. Furthermore, a new Page-Object style DSL will be demonstrated to show how you can replace Page-Object in a way that gives you far more control and flexibility, with minimal re-work to replace Page-Object.",time:"12:45 - 1:45",room:"Great Hall 1 & 2"}}}}}]);
