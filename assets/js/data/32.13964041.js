Unlike unit tests they’re tough to set up, slow to run, make permanent changes to data, and they’re incredibly brittle. Even a tiny CSS change can result in cascading failures! You can’t ignore these issues, but you CAN design around them by adopting a few key patterns and techniques. Data creation helpers let you construct intricate data graphs in one line of code. Page Objects abstract away tedious browser automation code and make tests resilient to changes in HTML structure. You'll also see some anti-patterns that are definitely NOT fun to write. Developers will leave this session prepared to inject some newfound joy into their UI testing efforts. (Some examples use WebDriver, although the session is largely test tool agnostic).",time:"9:15 - 10:15",room:"Student-Alumni Room"}}}}}]);
