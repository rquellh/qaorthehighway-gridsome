But how do you know you're doing it right? Are you getting the most out of the strategies you've chosen? In this session you'll learn how best to manage your automation, how different job types and plugins can improve your architecture and decrease your maintenance effort. One fascinating feature of Jenkins is that no matter where you are in your automation maturity, it seems like there's always another level of depth you can follow -- if you're using the basic point-and-click of freestyle jobs, you can move to the scripted context of pipelines. Once you've explored pipelines, you can learn to leverage shared global libraries to promote code reuse across multiple pipelines. In this session, you'll learn basics about Jenkins, specific use cases for different job types, and how best to manage your automation as it grows from one job, to ten, to one hundred. Finally, you'll learn how to create your entire Jenkins job collection from scratch, at the push of a button.",time:"1:55 - 2:55",room:"Great Hall 1 & 2"}}}}}]);
