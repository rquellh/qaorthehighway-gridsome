                "title": "Digital Transformation Requires Continuous Testing",
                "abstract": "Digital disruption is omnipresent. Organizations are asked (more than ever before) to constantly reinvent their businesses at the speed of ideas and to keep their customers at their epicenter at the same time. Venerable companies have become comfortable breaking down silos, changing cultural norms and driving efficiency at all costs to always be one step ahead of their competition. It is not any longer the strongest that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change. Change seems to be the only thing constant, the new currency, the silver bullet to stay competitive. Big words, such as DevOps, emerged out of this fear to be second-class, and even managed to penetrate into our daily testing routines. The ability to change fast while delivering high quality has become imperative for all businesses (small, medium, large). This level of transformation requires testing to no longer be a bottleneck. It requires continuous testing to make sure that the quality of the software that is being developed is measured continuously. In this talk, Ingo Philipp outlines how to unfold continuous testing into reality."

                "title": "DevOps: The Big Picture for Testers",
                "abstract": "If you put 50 folks from various parts of IT into a room, you'll get 20 different definitions of DevOps and 30 opinions as to why an organization should embrace it.  Therein lies a key challenge with any DevOps discussion.  Those individual views tend to be myopically focused on a specific area of interest to that single individual.  A tester may focus on automation or exploratory testing being tightly integrated, a developer may view DevOps as an extension of Continous Integration activities and tools.  A Scrum Master may see it as extending Agile into the Operations space.  Infrastructure may see it as cloud practices or Infrastructure as Code.  The truth is, DevOps is a bit of all of that - but it is so much more as well.  But if it is more than that, what does that mean for testers - their role, their skills, and their future?  During this presentation, we will discuss DevOps from a holistic organizational perspective, how DevOps capabilities in various areas are interrelated, and how it can impact your company's bottom line.  The goal would be for everyone to walk away with a common understanding of DevOps, how it makes your business more efficient and competitive, and how you can get involved in helping to grow DevOps - and future-proof your own career."
