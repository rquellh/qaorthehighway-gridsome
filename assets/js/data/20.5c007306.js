Therein lies a key challenge with any DevOps discussion.  Those individual views tend to be myopically focused on a specific area of interest to that single individual.  A tester may focus on automation or exploratory testing being tightly integrated, a developer may view DevOps as an extension of Continous Integration activities and tools.  A Scrum Master may see it as extending Agile into the Operations space.  Infrastructure may see it as cloud practices or Infrastructure as Code.  The truth is, DevOps is a bit of all of that - but it is so much more as well.  But if it is more than that, what does that mean for testers - their role, their skills, and their future?  During this presentation, we will discuss DevOps from a holistic organizational perspective, how DevOps capabilities in various areas are interrelated, and how it can impact your company's bottom line.  The goal would be for everyone to walk away with a common understanding of DevOps, how it makes your business more efficient and competitive, and how you can get involved in helping to grow DevOps - and future-proof your own career.",time:"4:15 - 5:15",room:"East Ballroom"}}}}}]);
