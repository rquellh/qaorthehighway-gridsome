For good reasons: lower costs, increased headcount, lower costs and potential 24-hour development cycles. But implementing an offshore model is difficult and can put many of these benefits at risk. Are your costs really lower when your Managers are spending all of their time reviewing the code or test cases? Can 1 offshore tester really equal the workload of 1 FTE? Is there truly a 24-hour development cycle? And do you even want one if it means your development team is in two locations? In this presentation we will address these and many more questions through a series of “best practices” developed over years of working with offshore teams.",time:"12:45 - 1:45",room:"Interfaith Room"}}}}}]);
