                "abstract": "Digital disruption is omnipresent. Organizations are asked (more than ever before) to constantly reinvent their businesses at the speed of ideas and to keep their customers at their epicenter at the same time. Venerable companies have become comfortable breaking down silos, changing cultural norms and driving efficiency at all costs to always be one step ahead of their competition. It is not any longer the strongest that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change. Change seems to be the only thing constant, the new currency, the silver bullet to stay competitive. Big words, such as DevOps, emerged out of this fear to be second-class, and even managed to penetrate into our daily testing routines. The ability to change fast while delivering high quality has become imperative for all businesses (small, medium, large). This level of transformation requires testing to no longer be a bottleneck. It requires continuous testing to make sure that the quality of the software that is being developed is measured continuously. In this talk, Ingo Philipp outlines how to unfold continuous testing into reality.",

                "abstract": "If you put 50 folks from various parts of IT into a room, you'll get 20 different definitions of DevOps and 30 opinions as to why an organization should embrace it.  Therein lies a key challenge with any DevOps discussion.  Those individual views tend to be myopically focused on a specific area of interest to that single individual.  A tester may focus on automation or exploratory testing being tightly integrated, a developer may view DevOps as an extension of Continous Integration activities and tools.  A Scrum Master may see it as extending Agile into the Operations space.  Infrastructure may see it as cloud practices or Infrastructure as Code.  The truth is, DevOps is a bit of all of that - but it is so much more as well.  But if it is more than that, what does that mean for testers - their role, their skills, and their future?  During this presentation, we will discuss DevOps from a holistic organizational perspective, how DevOps capabilities in various areas are interrelated, and how it can impact your company's bottom line.  The goal would be for everyone to walk away with a common understanding of DevOps, how it makes your business more efficient and competitive, and how you can get involved in helping to grow DevOps - and future-proof your own career.",

                "abstract": "Remember how apps used to be? They connected to the internet and incorporated one device at most. Sure, testers had to factor in performance under different usage conditions, but we had great testing toolsets in place to deal with that. Fast forward to the present. These days sensors enable much more diverse functionality from our connected devices or smartphones and that means mobile app testing is no longer just about testing the app. Smartphones now include many sensors that interface with the ecosystem around them. These software and hardware components can all too easily play havoc with the apps themselves. Customers expect to be able to sync data to smart watches, scan visual inputs using the camera function, perform biometric authentication, use geo-location and have their language commands processed and understood. And, of course, they expect it to work smoothly and the user experience to be intuitive. Organizations therefore require new strategies for test automation for this hyper-connected era. Nowadays mobile test automation is not complete unless it also incorporates how the app interacts with these sensors, peripherals and hardware. In this session, we will demonstrate the importance of making hardware and sensor testing an integral part of mobile app testing as well as share strategies for how to successfully do so. In this session, attendees will gain the following takeaways: -Overview of the complexity of peripherals testing -Demonstration of sensor testing scenarios including location, camera, TouchID and Bluetooth -Best practices, challenges and how to overcome them -Case study: Device peripheral automation for one the leading medical device & solution provider",

In this interactive live-coding presentation we will demonstrate the mechanics of TDD using the Fizz Buzz code kata. Fizz Buzz is a children’s game where one counts up to a given number but replaces any number divisible by three with the word \"Fizz\", and any number divisible by five with the word \"Buzz\". We will start with the acceptance criteria and implement the solution using Test Driven Development. Along the way we will use and discuss general testing concepts such as equivalence classes, boundary-value analysis, test data design, and tests as documentation. We will demonstrate how TDD drives us to solution faster by exposing and pinpointing bugs in our implementation and tests dispelling the common myth that TDD slows down development. This live-coding exercise demonstrates Ruby unit testing using RSpec but applies to any language and its testing framework.",

                "title": "Panoramic Quality",
                "abstract": "DevOps drastically changes the landscape of testing. Collaboration between operations and development teams enables a steady stream of small changes to be deployed to production. This pace of change puts a real strain on traditional testing activities. There used to be a sense of safety in dedicating hours or even days to testing after code is complete and before release, yet this is a luxury and liability in DevOps. The more time that elapses from when code is written to when it is deployed, the more risk is actually introduced. The geography of production code is in a constant state of change, so the longer testing takes the more the landscape around and even beneath you changes, and the more risk it accrues. This rapid rate of change requires testers to broaden their vision, and shift the focus and geography of their actions. In this talk testers will see that while they may have lost full ownership the testing tasks they are accustomed to performing, DevOps has expanded the opportunity for testers to become arbiters of quality. To help testers look beyond deriving quality from executing tests and shift towards becoming quality owners, I'll share 3 core responsibilities of testers in DevOps: to know, protect, and verify. I'll then provide four key areas of focus: code, customer, architecture, and environment discussing the how testers can establish quality ownership through these responsibilities. This talk will help testers to find their path to enabling continuous quality, sharing test ownership across the team while instilling value from pull request to production. Take Aways: -A working definition of Quality Ownership and its relationship to Product Ownership. -How testing needs to change depending on where code is running. -Why test against the developers local changes? -How testers can start taking ownership of code without knowing how to write it",

One obstacle facing professional development is lack of support and/or guidance from management. According to a recent survey by Robert Half Finance & Accounting, only 26% of employers allow their employees to attend continuing professional education courses during business hours. However, all is not lost: change can come from within rather than management. Employees can take the reins of continuous improvement and generate positive change for themselves & their organization. In this session, the audience will learn how to implement a robust continuous improvement curriculum that can be integrated into an organization's culture -- one training class, one conference, one professional group at a time.",

One fascinating feature of Jenkins is that no matter where you are in your automation maturity, it seems like there's always another level of depth you can follow -- if you're using the basic point-and-click of freestyle jobs, you can move to the scripted context of pipelines. Once you've explored pipelines, you can learn to leverage shared global libraries to promote code reuse across multiple pipelines. In this session, you'll learn basics about Jenkins, specific use cases for different job types, and how best to manage your automation as it grows from one job, to ten, to one hundred.

                "abstract": "Most in the Ruby automation world are very familiar with Page-Object and Watir. Page-Object served a very useful purpose, but as Watir-classic and Watir-webdriver issues have resolved into just Watir, it's time to consider refactoring Page-Object into something faster, easier, and more extensible. I have written a new DSL that makes declaring elements easier, and can actually be extended using the same patterns for the base set of elements. Furthermore, a new Page-Object style DSL will be demonstrated to show how you can replace Page-Object in a way that gives you far more control and flexibility, with minimal re-work to replace Page-Object.",

You’ll take away practical outcomes that will be relevant no matter where you are in your DevOps implementation. The role of QA/QE tends to be ambiguous within Agile teams who are pursuing the DevOps approach within their SDLC. There are many misconceptions around QE's role, automation, and which agile ceremonies make sense in DevOps. Melissa will share her insight on how she consults with companies - from startups to Fortune 100 companies - on the innovative ways QA/QE can add value to DevOps by focusing on efficient tasks. Key takeaways include: -Defining the QE Role -Re-tuning Automation -Shifting traditional QA/QE “right” tasks left -Re-defining Refining Shippable By deep-diving in to each topic, you'll get innovative ways to leverage Agile and QA/QE activities to ensure a consistent, efficient, and productive playbook for DevOps.",
